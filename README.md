# Library-Management-System-using-C
The term "Library Management System" refers to the idea of storing or documenting the specifics of books incorporated within the user's system. It includes information on the books' genres, lists, etc. The Library Management System can only be accessed by those who have the login information. That person is capable of carrying out a variety of tasks, including adding or removing book details, showing or changing book details, etc. To securely save book details kept in the library, we must make use of the library management system ( probably ). This option is typically turned on to protect the extremely secret data. The C programming language was used to create one of the simplest management systems.
It is an application that may be used to manage a library digitally and is console-based. It has C language programming. It offers all essential features, including the ability to add books and users, search for books and users, issue and submit books, delete books and users, and print a list of all the books in the library. If the reader has a book that has to be submitted, it will be verified before issuing the book. Additionally, a book's availability is mentioned in the book information. This project's main benefit is that it makes managing a library a lot simpler. This makes keeping track of the data simple. It makes a big difference in the amount of paper used in library administration.
